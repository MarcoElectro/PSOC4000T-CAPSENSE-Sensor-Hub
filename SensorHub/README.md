# KiCad Project for Sensor Hub PCB
The PCB conists of an PSOC4000T and a few additional components,
making the board a simple and cheap option to use Infineon`s CAPSENSE technology for capacitive sensors.

For programming an SWD Programmer is needed. 
I used the MiniProg4 (CY8CKIT-005-A).

Soldering the PSOC4000T is easy using solder paste and a heat plate or air soldering station.

Feel free to improve the layout and update it to your needs.
